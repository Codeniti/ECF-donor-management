Set up in 2009, Equal Community Foundation is a non-profit organisation based in Pune, India that works with men to end violence and discrimination against women.</b>

<h5 class="tw_bullet"><font color="red">Why do we do what we do</font></h5><br><br>
<p><b>

<img src="images/gallery/images (8).jpg"  height="250" width="300"><br><br>
Over 100 million women in India continue to face violence and discrimination at the hands of men. The traditional approach to tackling this problem is to support women directly i.e. womenâ€™s empowerment. This approach does not tackle discrimination at its root and is alone not delivering the anticipated or required results in reducing inequality and violence.

<h5 class="tw_bullet"><font color="red">How will we achieve our mission</font></h5><br><br>
<p><b>

<img src="images/gallery/images.jpg"  height="250" width="300"><br><br>
We will deliver on our mission by inspiring and informing a new generation of social programming that raises men to end violence and discrimination against women. We will inspire and inform this movement by developing behaviour change programmes that empower men; researching and reporting on the approach in India; and developing a popular movement supporting the approach.
